                    <h2> 1. Programming </h2>
                    <p>I have been programming since middle school. My first CS project was about creating a robot car entirely from scratch. This has driven my passion since then, and now I speak with computers for a living.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I love all the aspects of programming and IT. I tried backend, frontend, mobile dev, machine learning, and embedded dev, but my favorite is creating large-scale, blazingly fast (ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€) high-performance systems. Concurrency, Infra, Security, Distributed Systems - all these topics are challenging yet engaging! Nobody thinks about them when using one popular website or another, but they are part of the core, without which nothing like this would even be possible. Itâ€™s so interesting to know how <a href="https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-trillions-of-messages">Discord handles trillions of messages</a>, how <a href="https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex/articles/577040/">Yandex handled one of the biggest DDoS attacks in the history</a>, and so on.

                    <h2> 2. Aviation </h2>
                    <p>I didnâ€™t really want to become a programmer in the first place. My dream was to become a commercial pilot! Aviation is such an exciting topic, too; it could even compete with programming, haha. There are so many procedures to follow, checklists to go through, systems to work with, and clouds to stare at during the flight.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, itâ€™s unlikely that I will become a commercial pilot for many reasons, including not having ideal health. But nothing stops me from getting a Private Pilot License! This is one of my life goals, to become a private pilot :)
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        For now, I just fly in flight sims, using high-realistic DLCs and plugins. Graphics and realism have taken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReDDgFfWlS4">a big step forward</a> recently.

                    <h2> 3. Linguistics </h2>
                    <p>Once I reached some level of fluency in English, I realized that a language is a key to another cultural world, where you can meet new people, find new ideas, get new solutions, and discover new prospects. Thatâ€™s why I decided to continue the journey and learn new languages after finishing my English courses at the uni.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I took a yearly German course and it was *fantastisch*! Although I reached only A1+ in German, I am pretty satisfied with the progress. Now, I am taking French courses and use the language daily in Lausanne. Learning a new language gives me so many opportunities that I probably wouldnâ€™t be able to accomplish all of this (including writing this page) if I didnâ€™t know English. Imagine how much I can do once I learn French or German!
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        But despite the practicality standpoint, learning a new language is just a game for me, a detective one - you have an unknown cipher, and you have to decode it :). Itâ€™s fun, and thatâ€™s why I do it.
