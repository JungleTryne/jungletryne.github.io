                    <h2> 1. Programming </h2>
                    <p>I have been programming since middle school. 
                        My first CS project was about creating a robot-car completely 
                        from scratch. This has driven my passion since then, 
                        and now I speak with computers for a living.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I love all the aspects of programming and IT. I tried backend, frontend, mobile dev, machine learning, embedded dev, but the most favourite one for me is creating large-scale blazingly fast (ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€) high-performance systems. Concurrency, Infra, Security, Distributed Systems, all these topics are so challenging, yet so interesting! Nobody thinks about them when using one popular website or another, but they are the part of the core without which nothing like this would be even possible. Itâ€™s so interesting to know how <a href="https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-trillions-of-messages">Discord handles trillions of messages</a>, or how <a href="https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex/articles/577040/">Yandex handled one of the biggest DDoS attacks in the history</a>, and so on.

                    <h2> 2. Aviation </h2>
                    <p>I didnâ€™t really want to become a programmer in the first place. My dream was to become a commercial pilot! Aviation is such an interesting topic too, it could even compete with programming, haha. So many procedures to follow, so many checklists to go through, so many systems to work with and... so many clouds to stare at during the flight.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, itâ€™s unlikely that I will become a commercial pilot due to many reasons, including not ideal health. But nothing stops me from getting a Private Pilot License! So, this is one of my life goals, to become a private pilot :)
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        For now, I just fly in flight sims, using high-realistic DLCs and plugins. Graphics and realism there have taken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReDDgFfWlS4">a big step forward</a> since recently.

                    <h2> 3. Linguistics </h2>
                    <p>Once I reached some level of fluency in English, I realised that a language is a key to another cultural world, where you can meet new people, find new ideas, get new solutions and discover new prospectives on your life. Thatâ€™s why once I had finished my English courses at the uni I decided to continue the journey and learn new languages.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I took a yearly German course and it was *fantastisch*! Although I reached only A1+ level in German, I am quite satisfied with the progress. Now I am taking French courses and use the language daily in Lausanne. I know that learning a new language gives me so many opportunities, I probably wouldnâ€™t be able to accomplish all of this (including writing this website) if I didnâ€™t know English. Imagine how much I will be able to do once I learn French or German!
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        But despite the practicality standpoint, learning a new language is just a game for me, a detective one - you have an unknown cypher and you have to decode it :). Itâ€™s fun, and thatâ€™s why I do it.
